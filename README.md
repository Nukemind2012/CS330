How do I approach designing software?

My approach to designing software is simple- I start with the endgoal. From there I work backwards, trying to figure out what I need at each step along with way!

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

What hasn't it? I learned to make 3D scenes. I learned how to apply textures, collissions, and so much more. I learned so much in this class it isn't even funny!

What design process did you follow for your project work?

I basically did alot of studying every single week then implementation. I slowly chipped away at it but when Law School and my job weren't keeping me busy I would attack it all at once!

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?


In the future I won't have as much of a crunch but I will take much the same approach- doing a single big attack when I can but slowly and surely accumulating advancements the rest of the time.


How do I approach developing programs?

Same idea- start with the end goal and from there work backwards.


What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I started with the plane, and some bases. I also focused on trying to visualize and put in things that would be duplicated so I could rapidly attack it later.

How did iteration factor into your development?

Each step was a new idea- lighting, structures, textures, etc. So each iteration added something new to the pie. At the same time I made sure that from the start I was adding in the structures I would need.


How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?


For one I have stopped procrastinating. Doing it early is *so* much better.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

It will allow me to be a patent lawyer but, mmore than that, it will allow me to be successful in life. The skills I learn here can be applied to a broad range of careers.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

They give me the ability to add in a graphics based program to what I have learned before, and more ethan that help people patent them!
